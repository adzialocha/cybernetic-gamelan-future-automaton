## About

*"... soft thought is not there to be understood as a new cognitive function or as a transcendent form of rationality, but to reveal that programming culture is infected by incomputable thoughts that are yet to be accounted for."* (Luciana Parisi)

The Cybernetic Gamelan Future Automaton is a network-based browser game for human laptop performers, developed by [Andreas Dzialocha](https://andreasdzialocha.com). Each performer controls its own future-gamelan instrument using text symbols while travelling inside a 3D universe of parametric architectures, visualizing how algorithms generate and represent knowledge.
